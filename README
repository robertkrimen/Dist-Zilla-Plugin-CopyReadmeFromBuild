NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CopyReadmeFromBuild - Copy README after building
    (for SCM inclusion, etc.)

VERSION
    version 0.0019

SYNOPSIS
    In your Dist::Zilla "dist.ini":

        [CopyReadmeFromBuild]

DESCRIPTION
    CopyReadmeFromBuild will automatically copy the README from the build
    directory into the distribution directory. This is so you can commit the
    README to version control. GitHub, for example, likes to see a README

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Readme will not like it if you already have a
    README, so you'll have to disable that plugin, an example of which is:

        [@Filter]
        bundle = @Basic
        remove = Readme

AfterBuild/AfterRelease
    With the release of 0.0016, this plugin changed to performing the copy
    during the AfterRelease stage instead of the AfterBuild stage. To enable
    the old behavior, set the environment variable
    DZIL_CopyFromBuildAfterBuild to 1:

        $ DZIL_CopyFromBuildAfterBuild=1 dzil build
